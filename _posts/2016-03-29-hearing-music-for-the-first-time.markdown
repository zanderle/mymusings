There are days when I'll put on one of Satchmo's records and just love and enjoy the music. Then there are days when I put on his music and listen in admiration. AND THEN there are days when I'm doing something else entirely and simply have some music playing.

Until a certain song comes up and hits me like a train; mind you, a song I've listened to countless times before. The song comes up, and in the middle of my work I realize I suddenly stop typing and start listening. Intensely. Not because I'm intrigued, but because I'm stunned. As if I've heard it for the first time, I am in awe. The singing, the moans, that beautiful, heart-wrenching solo. And man, that otherworldly glissando.

After listening to what surely must be hundreds of hours of his music, how can his music still sound so fresh?! How can he still surprise me, like I'm hearing him for the first time? I don't think I'll ever know. But what a great thing it is.
