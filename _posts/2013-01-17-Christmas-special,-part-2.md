Here’s a follow-up on the post I did a few days ago. This time around, I’ll
mention a few Christmas albums that are a bit different from the usual stuff.
A kind of change that is very welcomed among Christmas music, that otherwise
sounds the same most of the time.  
  
First off, it’s the Godfather of Soul - James Brown and his album [James
Brown's Funky Christmas](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001EFD/ref=as_li
_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mythougonmusi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creat
iveASIN=B000001EFD)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000001EFD).
The title pretty
much sums it up and it’s quite an unusual combination, at least for my ears,
but that doesn’t mean it’s not good. If you ask me, it’s actually great. There
are a few misses along the way, but overall it’s a great Christmas album, with
amazing, powerful, ![](http://www.funkmysoul.gr/wp-content/uploads/2009/12
/james-brown-funky-christmas-300x300.jpg)energetic James’ singing. I
definitely recommend it, if you’re in the mood for something different. Listen
to [Sweet Little Baby Boy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2GD8nQDxeE) or[
Let’s Make Christmas Mean Something This
Year](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUabyfwVDuI) to get a taste of it. Do you
know the song Please Come Home For Christmas? Here’s James Brown’s surprising
rendition. It’s very different from other versions which is exactly why I love
it.

[The First Lady of TheSong](http://musingsonmusic.com/2012/11/the-first-lady-of-song.html)
recorded Christmas albums too. And good thing she did. Listen to
[Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006WL1Q/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mythougonmusi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00006WL1Q)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00006WL1Q)
to hear how classic
Christmas songs were supposed to be sung. Here’s my favourite on the album,
‘[What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYkjz-
6nic8)’.  
  
Last, but not least is one of my favourite musicians of all time,[ Ray
Charles](http://musingsonmusic.com/2012/08/rainy-night-in-
georgia.html). In 1985, he recorded [The Spirit of Christmas](http://www.amazo
n.com/gp/product/B002D3I1TO/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mythougonmusi-20&linkC
ode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002D3I1TO)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mythougonmusi-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002D3I1TO). Before this year,
I didn’t even know he recorded a Christmas album. I think I know, which album
I’ll have on repeat this Christmas. The warm, soulful sounds Ray managed to
create time and again, fit perfectly with the Christmas spirit and the result
can be heard on this album. I wouldn't listen to this album outside the
Christmas season though, for it sounds cheesy at times. But since it is
Christmas, I love it!

Here’s my favourite on the album, ‘[All I Want For
Christmas](http://youtu.be/EEeTnZuVcB0?t=4m8s)’, and don’t let the title scare
you, it’s not Mariah Carey...  
  
What are your favourites? What do you think of my humble selection? Comments
from anyone are, as always, welcome.  
Next time, since a good friend requested it, it’s Otis Redding (if anyone else
has any requests, you should never hesitate!). I’m Looking forward to this
one! I’ll leave you off with a great song, which connects this post and the
next.
