Bluesman by Žan Anderle

I absolutely love the blues! I started listening to it at about the same time
as jazz and I love it just the same.  
My favourite is the acoustic blues. It’s straight on blues without anything to
either enhance it or deprive it of its original sound. I definitely enjoy
other types of blues as well, but there’s just something about the rawness of
the acoustic blues that draws me to it.  
With this post, I feel like expounding on it would be thinking about it too
much and feeling it too little. So without further ado, here are a few
examples of acoustic blues or in other words, what I think is a glimpse of the
artist’s pains, problems and sorrows in the form of a song.  
  
(for these next recordings, try to hear past the bad sound quality)  
The amazing Robert Johnson and his [Sweet Home
Chicago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8hqGu-leFc). There’s so much to talk
about him, he definitely deserves a post of his own, which I’ll probably write
sometime soon.  
  
Blind Willie McTell and [Stole Rider
Blues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENFCVrFffrE). He’s a perfect example of
someone I enjoy listening to very much, but can’t explain at all why. It’s
somewhat of mystery to me.  
  
And here’s something more modern, with a lot better sound quality - Taj Mahal
and [Stagger Lee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAPF42aAXSM). Taj Mahal is
someone who I’ll write about in the future too.  
  
What about you? Do you like the blues and do you enjoy the acoustic blues as
much as I do? What are some other songs or styles of blues you enjoy? I would
love to hear your opinions.  
  
Next time I’ll do a post on Solomon Burke, so until then, everyone.
